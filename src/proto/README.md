=====
The Raft data models implemented using protocol buffers.

All modules here are generated from the protocol buffers code found in `protobuf/`. The only exceptions to this are files suffixed with `_ext.rs`, which are extensions to the generated code, and `mod.rs`. Do not modify the generated code by hand.
