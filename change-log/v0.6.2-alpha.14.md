-   Fixed: [8cd24ba0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/8cd24ba0f0212e94e61f21a7be0ce0806fcc66d5) RaftCore.entries_cache is inconsistent with storage. removed it.; by drdr xp; 2021-08-23

    - When leader changes, `entries_cache` is cleared.
      Thus there may be cached entries wont be applied to state machine.

    - When applying finished, the applied entries are not removed from the
      cache.
      Thus there could be entries being applied more than once.
