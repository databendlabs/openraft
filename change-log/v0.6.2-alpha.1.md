-   Added: [1ad17e8e](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/1ad17e8edf18d98eeb687f00a65ebf528ab3aeb7) move wait_for_xxx util into metrics.; by drdr xp; 2021-06-16

    Introduce struct `Wait` as a wrapper of the metrics channel to impl
    wait-for utils:
    - `log()`:  wait for log to apply.
    - `current_leader()`: wait for known leader.
    - `state()`: wait for the role.
    - `members()`: wait for membership_config.members.
    - `next_members()`: wait for membership_config.members_after_consensus.

    E.g.:

    ```rust
    // wait for ever for raft node's current leader to become 3:
    r.wait(None).current_leader(2).await?;
    ```

    The timeout is now an option arg to all wait_for_xxx functions in
    fixtures. wait_for_xxx_timeout are all removed.
