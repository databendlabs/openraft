### Improved:

-   Improved: [23f4a73b](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/23f4a73b2382d55deac849db1767519a91c23796) AppDataResponse does not need a Clone trait bound; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-09

    - Fix: #703

-   Improved: [664635e0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/664635e0e6d29ea4fa84e6f579d0c785f3a513e7) loosen validity check with RaftState.snapshot_last_log_id(); by 张炎泼; 2023-03-10

    A application may not persist snapshot. And when it restarted, the
    last-purged-log-id is not `None` but `snapshot_last_log_id()` is None.
    This is a valid state and should not emit error.

-   Improved: [54aea8a2](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/54aea8a267741ca458c86ef1885041d244817c86) fix: delay election if a greater last log id is seen; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-14

    If this node sees a greater last-log-id on another node, it will be less
    likely to be elected as a leader.
    In this case, it is necessary to sleep for a longer period of time
    `smaller_log_timeout` so that other nodes with a greater last-log-id
    have a chance to elect themselves.

    Fix: such as state should be kept until next election, i.e., it should
    be a field of `Engine` instead of a `field` of `internal_server_state`.
    And this value should be greater than the `election_timeout` of every other node.
