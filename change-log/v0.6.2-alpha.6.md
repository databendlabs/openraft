### Changed:

-   Changed: [82a3f2f9](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/82a3f2f9c7ac37a0f24c6e0e8993c8d3bcee5666) use LogId to track last applied instead of using just an index.; by drdr xp; 2021-07-19

    It provides more info by Using LogId to track last applied log.
    E.g. when creating a snapshot, it need to walk through logs to find the
    term of the last applied log, just like it did in memstore impl.

    Using LogId{term, index} is a more natural way in every aspect.

    changes: RaftCore: change type of `last_applied` from u64 to LogId.
