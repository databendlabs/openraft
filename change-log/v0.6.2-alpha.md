    Internally when replication goes to LaggingState(a non-leader lacks a lot logs), the
    ReplicationCore purges `outbound_buffer` and `replication_buffer` and then sends all
    **committed** logs found in storage.

    Thus if there are uncommitted logs in `replication_buffer`, these log will never have chance to
    be replicated, even when replication goes back to LineRateState.
    Since LineRateState only replicates logs from `ReplicationCore.outbound_buffer` and
    `ReplicationCore.replication_buffer`.

    This test ensures that when replication goes to LineRateState, it tries to re-send all logs
    found in storage(including those that are removed from the two buffers.

    A leader adds all follower replication states to a hashset `nodes`, when
    the leader is established.
    But the leader does not do it when membership changed.
    Thus when a follower is removed, the leader cannot stop replication to
    it because the follower is not in `nodes`.

    The solution is to move replication state from `non_voters` to `nodes`.
    So that next time a follower is removed the leader is able to remove the
    replication from `nodes`.

    Counting only the follower(nodes) as quorum for new config(c1) results
    in unexpected log commit.
    E.g.: change from 012 to 234, when 3 and 4 are unreachable, the first
    log of joint should not be committed.

    - Simplify CI test: test all in one action.

    - Disable clippy: it suggests inappropriate assert_eq to assert
      conversion which is used in a macro.

    - Add makefile

    - Build only with nightly rust. Add rust-toolchain to specify toolchain
      version.
