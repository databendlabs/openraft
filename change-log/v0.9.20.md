-   Fixed: [33fde29d](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/33fde29d03c172b1514e2f91d854bc5b6aa9be09) reset progress when heartbeat response indicates conflict; by Zhang Yanpo; 2025-06-19

    With `loosen-follower-log-revert` enabled:

    Before this fix, `RaftCore` ignored `conflict` messages from `Heartbeat` RPCs,
    preventing leaders from discovering follower state changes. When a follower's
    state reverted and responded with a conflict message, the leader wouldn't
    retransmit necessary data to the follower.

    This commit ensures `conflict` responses are always processed properly and
    progress is reset to trigger data retransmission to the follower.
