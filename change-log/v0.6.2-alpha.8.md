### Changed:

-   Changed: [adc24f55](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/adc24f55d75d9c7c01fcd0f4f9e35dd5aae679aa) pass all logs to apply_entry_to_state_machine(), not just Normal logs.; by drdr xp; 2021-08-16

    Pass `Entry<D>` to `apply_entry_to_state_machine()`, not just the only
    `EntryPayload::Normal(normal_log)`.

    Thus the state machine is able to save the membership changes if it
    prefers to.

    Why:

    In practice, a snapshot contains info about all applied logs, including
    the membership config log.
    Before this change, the state machine does not receive any membership
    log thus when making a snapshot, one needs to walk through all applied
    logs to get the last membership that is included in state machine.

    By letting the state machine remember the membership log applied,
    the snapshto creation becomes more convenient and intuitive: it does not
    need to scan the applied logs any more.
