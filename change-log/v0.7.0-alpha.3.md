### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [44381b0c](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/44381b0c776cfbb7dfc7789de27346110776b7f6) when handling append-entries, if prev_log_id is purged, it should not delete any logs.; by 张炎泼; 2022-08-14

    When handling append-entries, if the local log at `prev_log_id.index` is
    purged, a follower should not believe it is a **conflict** and should
    not delete all logs. It will get committed log lost.

    To fix this issue, use `last_applied` instead of `committed`:
    `last_applied` is always the committed log id, while `committed` is not
    persisted and may be smaller than the actually applied, when a follower
    is restarted.
