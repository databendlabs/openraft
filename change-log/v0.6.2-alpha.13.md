### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [2eccb9e1](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/2eccb9e1f82f1bf71f6a2cf9ef6da7bf6232fa84) install snapshot req with offset GE 0 should not start a new session.; by drdr xp; 2021-08-22

    A install-snapshot always ends with a req with data len to be 0 and
    offset GE 0.
    If such a req is re-sent, e.g., when timeout, the receiver will try to
    install a snapshot with empty data, if it just finished the previous
    install snapshot req(`snapshot_state` is None) and do not reject a
    install snapshot req with offset GE 0.
    Which results in a `fatal storage error`, since the storage tries to
    decode an empty snapshot data.

    - feature: add config `install_snapshot_timeout`.
