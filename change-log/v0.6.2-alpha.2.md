    In LeaderState it also report metrics about the replication to other node when report metrics.

    When switched to other state, LeaderState will be destroyed as long as
    the cached replication metrics.

    Other state report an `None` to raft core to override the previous
    metrics data.

    At some point the raft core, without knonwning the state, just report
    metrics with an `Update::Ignore`, to indicate that leave replication
    metrics intact.
