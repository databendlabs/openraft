### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [cf4badd0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/cf4badd0d762757519e2db5ed2f2fc65c2f49d02) leader should re-create and send snapshot when `threshold/2 < last_log_index - snapshot < threshold`; by drdr xp; 2021-07-08

    The problem:

    If `last_log_index` advances `snapshot.applied_index` too many, i.e.:
    `threshold/2 < last_log_index - snapshot < threshold`
    (e.g., `10/2 < 16-10 < 20` in the test that reproduce this bug), the leader
    tries to re-create a new snapshot. But when
    `last_log_index < threshold`, it won't create, which result in a dead
    loop.

    Solution:

    In such case, force to create a snapshot without considering the
    threshold.
