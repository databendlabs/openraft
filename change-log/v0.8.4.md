### Added:

-   Added: [e39da9f0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/e39da9f022f5411b8828fac096cd8bcd118d6426) define custom `Entry` type for raft log; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-16

    This commit introduces a new feature that allows applications to define
    a custom type for Raft log entries in `RaftTypeConfig`. By setting `Entry =
    MyEntry`, where `MyEntry` implements the `RaftEntry` trait, an application
    can now define its own log entry type that reflects its architecture.
    However, the default implementation, the `Entry` type is still available.

    This change provides more flexibility for applications to tailor the
    Raft log entry to their specific needs.

    - Fix: #705

    - Changes: `RaftStorage::append_to_log()` and `RaftStorage::apply_to_state_machine()` accepts slice of entries instead of slice of entry references.

-   Added: [87d62d56](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/87d62d5666af0a0d7f7ffa056057f53f1402d33e) add feature flag storage-v2 to enable `RaftLogStorage` and `RaftStateMachine`; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-19

    `storage-v2`: enables `RaftLogStorage` and `RaftStateMachine` as the v2 storage
    This is a temporary feature flag, and will be removed in the future, when v2 storage is stable.
    This feature disables `Adapter`, which is for v1 storage to be used as v2.
    V2 storage separates log store and state machine store so that log IO and state machine IO can be parallelized naturally.

-   Added: [229f3368](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/229f33689fd949eca9fa29fadf2e1285fcb21365) add backoff strategy for unreachable nodes; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-21

    Implements a backoff strategy for temporarily or permanently unreachable nodes.
    If the `Network` implementation returns `Unreachable` error, Openraft
    will backoff for a while before sending next RPC to this target.
    This mechanism prevents error logging flood.

    Adds a new method `backoff()` to `RaftNetwork` to let an application
    return a customized backoff policy, the default provided backoff just
    constantly sleep 500ms.

    Adds an `unreachable_nodes` setting to the testing router `TypedRaftRouteryped` to emulate unreachable nodes.
    Add new error `Unreachable` and an `RPCError` variant `Unreachable`.

    - Fix: #462

-   Added: [f0dc0eb7](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/f0dc0eb7f7fa18d5f546615c51c0f74815457449) add `RaftMetrics::purged` to report the last purged log id; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-01

-   Added: [37e96482](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/37e96482e4f446586af55827cbfff51102f2058e) add `Wait::purged()` to wait for purged to become the expected; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-01

-   Added: [0b419eb6](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/0b419eb619b15139df50798deca61e61998e4c41) add `RaftMetrics.vote`, `Wait::vote()`; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-02

    The latest approved value of `Vote`, which has been saved to disk, is
    referred to as `RaftMetrics.vote`. Additionally, a new `vote()` method
    has been included in `Wait` to enable the application to wait for `vote`
    to reach the anticipated value.

-   Added: [ee7b8853](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/ee7b8853d935ce5f47848d8f62b09e5c83c05c69) new `RaftNetwork` API with argument `RCPOption`; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-02

    - `RaftNetwork` introduced 3 new API `append_entries`,
      `install_snapshot` and `vote` which accept an additional argument
      `RPCOption`, and deprecated the old API `send_append_entries`,
      `send_install_snapshot` and `send_vote`.

    - The old API will be **removed** in `0.9`. An application can still
      implement the old API without any changes. Openraft calls only the new
      API and the default implementation will delegate to the old API.

    - Implementing the new APIs will disable the old APIs.

    - The new APIs accepts an additional argument `RPCOption`, to enable an
      application control the networking behaviors based on the parameters
      in `RPCOption`.

      The `hard_ttl()` and `soft_ttl()` in `RPCOption` sets the hard limit
      and the moderate limit of the duration for which an RPC should run.
      Once the `soft_ttl()` ends, the RPC implementation should start to
      gracefully cancel the RPC, and once the `hard_ttl()` ends, Openraft
      will terminate the ongoing RPC at once.

    - Fix: #819

-   Added: [1ee82cb8](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/1ee82cb82ed9a33015e23fe4ba571a42323cc7cd) `RaftNetwork::send_append_entries()` can return `PartialSuccess`; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-03

    If there are too many log entries and the `RPCOption.ttl` is not
    sufficient, an application can opt to only send a portion of the
    entries, with `AppendEntriesResponse::PartialSuccess(Option<LogId>)`, to
    inform Openraft with the last replicated log id. Thus replication can
    still make progress.

    For example, it tries to send log entries `[1-2..3-10]`, the application
    is allowed to send just `[1-2..1-3]` and return `PartialSuccess(1-3)`,

    ### Caution

    The returned matching log id must be **greater than or equal to** the
    first log id(`AppendEntriesRequest::prev_log_id`) of the entries to
    send. If no RPC reply is received, `RaftNetwork::send_append_entries`
    **must** return an `RPCError` to inform Openraft that the first log
    id(`AppendEntriesRequest::prev_log_id`) may not match on the remote
    target node.

    - Fix: #822

-   Added: [e9eed210](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/e9eed210fc2977c9e6e94a6fc1dd2cadf51362e7) leader lease; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-19

    The leader records the most recent time point when an RPC is initiated
    towards a target node. The highest timestamp associated with RPCs made
    to a quorum serves as the starting time point for a leader lease.

    Improve: use tokio::Instant to replace TimeState

    Use `Instant` for timekeeping instead of a custom `TimeState` struct.
    Because multiple components need to generate timestamp, not only the
    `RaftCore`, e.g., the `ReplicationCore`. And generating a timestamp is
    not in the hot path, therefore caching it introduces unnecessary
    complexity.

-   Added: [269d221c](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/269d221c0fd43cab4a4064de342943e58adf2757) add `SnapshotPolicy::Never`; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-24

    With `SnapshotPolicy::Never`, Openraft will not build snapshots
    automatically based on a policy. Instead, the application has full
    control over when snapshots are built. In this scenario, the application
    can call the `Raft::trigger_snapshot()` API at the desired times to
    manually trigger Openraft to build a snapshot.

    Rename integration tests:
    - `log_compaction -> snapshot_building`
    - `snapshto -> snapshot_streaming`

    -  Fix: #851

-   Added: [9e7195a1](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/9e7195a1f37ff09f45a4f97f2b6a0473c322c604) add `Raft::purge_log()`; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-24

    This method allows users to purge logs when required.
    It initiates the log purge up to and including the given `upto` log index.

    Logs that are not included in a snapshot will **NOT** be purged.
    In such scenario it will delete as many log as possible.
    The `max_in_snapshot_log_to_keep` config is not taken into account when
    purging logs.

    Openraft won't purge logs at once, e.g. it may be delayed by several
    seconds, because if it is a leader and a replication task has been
    replicating the logs to a follower, the logs can't be purged until the
    replication task is finished.

    - Fix: #852

### Improved:

-   Improved: [dbac91d5](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/dbac91d5dc26fd92a8ac5038220176823d9d6d29) send `AppendEntries` response before committing entries; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-04

    When a follower receives an append-entries request that includes a
    series of log entries to append and the log id that the leader
    has committed, it responds with an append-entries response after
    committing and applying the entries.

    However, this is not strictly necessary. The follower could simply send
    the response as soon as the log entries have been appended and flushed
    to disk, without waiting for them to be committed.

-   Improved: [6769cdd0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/6769cdd09c045757b19cbb3222225b86db28e936) move state machine operations to another task; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-13

    State machine operations, such as applying log entries, building/installing/getting snapshot are moved to `core::sm::Worker`, which is run in a standalone task other than the one running `RaftCore`.
    In this way, log io operation(mostly appending log entries) and state machine io operations(mostly applying log entries) can be paralleled.

    - Log io are sitll running in `RaftCore` task.

    - Snapshot receiving/streaming are removed from `RaftCore`.

    - Add `IOState` to `RaftState` to track the applied log id.

      This field is used to determine whether a certain command, such as
      sending a response, can be executed after a specific log has been
      applied.

    - Refactor: `leader_step_down()` can only be run when the response of the second change-membership is sent.
      Before this commit, updating the `committed` is done atomically with
      sending back response. Since thie commit, these two steps are done
      separately, because applying log entries are moved to another task.
      Therefore `leader_step_down()` must wait for these two steps to be
      finished.

-   Improved: [dcd18c53](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/dcd18c5387e723f2619e695407edd81eeaefa547) getting a snapshot does not block `RaftCore` task; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-16

    `RaftCore` no longer blocks on receiving a snapshot from the state-machine
    worker while replicating a snapshot. Instead, it sends the `Receiver` to
    the replication task and the replication task blocks on receiving the
    snapshot.

-   Improved: [6eeb5246](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/6eeb5246e145a6a5f62e9ba483dcaa6c346fcbb6) reduce rate to flush metrics; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-23

    The performance increases by 40% with this optimization:

    `tx_notify` will be used for components such as state-machine worker or
    replication stream to send back notification when an action is done.

    `tx_api` is left for receiving only external messages, such as
    append-entries request or client-write request.

    A `Balancer` is added to prevent one channel from starving the others.

    The benchmark shows a better performance with 64 clients:

    Receiving snapshot chunk should not be run in RaftCore task.
    Otherwise it will block RaftCore.

    In this commit this task is moved to sm::Worker, running in another
    task. The corresponding responding command will not be run until
    sm::Worker notify RaftCore receiving is finished.

    Before this commit, snapshot is built in the `sm::Worker`, which blocks
    other state-machine writes, such as applying log entries.

    This commit parallels applying log entries and building snapshot: A
    snapshot is built in another `tokio::task`.

    Because building snapshot is a read operation, it does not have to
    block the entire state machine. Instead, it only needs a consistent view
    of the state machine or holding a lock of the state machine.

    The `RaftStateMachine::apply()` and `RaftLogStorage::append_to_log()`
    method contains a `Send` bound on the `IntoIterator` passed to it.
    However, the actual iterator returned from `IntoIterator` doesn't have
    it. Thus, it's impossible to iterate across awaits in the
    implementation.

    The correct API should be:

    ```
    async fn apply<I>(&mut self, entries: I) -> Result<...>
    where
        I: IntoIterator<Item = C::Entry> + Send,

-   Fixed: [26dc8837](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/26dc8837f4f5afb9be30a32b3eae90235546ca3a) `ProgressEntry::is_log_range_inflight()` checks a log range, not a log entry; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-12

    This bug causes replication tries to send pruged log.

-   Fixed: [3433126c](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/3433126c28c54e307967ad01c4464d5db45ad246) `compat07::SnapshotMeta` should decode v08 `SnapshotMeta`; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-15

-   Fixed: [b97edb49](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/b97edb49fadbe8ed1ae725e9a85bd7fa2e044c9a) incorrect debug level log; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-22

    This results in unnecessary debug log output.

-   Fixed: [d012705d](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/d012705d8bbeb2e820447fd475a493b6831b5d3c) replication should be able to shutdown when replicating snapshot to unreachable node; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-01

    If a replication is sending a snapshot, it should
    periodically verify the input channel's status. When the input channel
    is closed during replication rebuilding, it should immediately exit the
    loop instead of attempting retries indefinitely.

    - Fix: #808

-   Fixed: [f505d7e6](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/f505d7e6ddc63c2526d1af2a9acf806b526ce410) `Raft::add_learner()` should block forever; by 张炎泼; 2023-05-20

    The `Raft::add_learner()` method, when invoked with the `blocking`
    parameter set to `true`, should block forever until the learner
    synchronizes its logs with the leader.

    In its current implementation, `add_learner()` calls the `Raft::wait()`
    method, which has a default timeout of `500ms`. To achieve the desired
    blocking behavior, the default timeout should be increased
    significantly.

    - Fix: #846

### Changed:

-   Changed: [a92499f2](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/a92499f20360f0f6eba3452e6944702d6a50f56d) `StoreBuilder` does not need to run a test, it only needs to build a store; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-21

    `StoreBuilder::run_test()` is removed, and a new method `build()` is
    added. To test a `RaftStorage` implementation, just implementing
    `StoreBuilder::build()` is enough now. It returns a store instance and a
    **guard**, for disk backed store to clean up the data when the guard is
    dropped.

-   Changed: [6e9d3573](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/6e9d35736a0967f06d9e334a0286208e7d6fe123) remove `Clone` from trait `AppData`; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-26

    Application data `AppData` does not have to be `Clone`.

    Upgrade tip:

    Nothing needs to be done.
    The default `RaftEntry` implementation `Entry` provided by openraft is
    still `Clone`, if the AppData in it is `Clone`.

-   Changed: [285e6225](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/285e6225d3e0e8363d8b194e09a113f4e9750b81) instead of a slice, `RaftStorage::append_to_log()` now accepts an `IntoIterator`; by 张炎泼; 2023-03-27

    Using an `IntoIterator` is more generic than using a slice, and
    could avoid potential memory allocation for the slice.

    Upgrade tip:

    Update the method signature in the `RaftStorage` implementation and
    ensure that it compiles without errors.
    The method body may require minimal modifications as as the new input
    type is just a more general type.

-   Changed: [e0569988](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/e05699889e18e45eeb021ffdf8ca7924d8c218a3) remove unused trait `RaftStorageDebug`; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-10

    `RaftStorageDebug` has only one method `get_state_machine()`,
    and state machine is entirely a user defined struct. Obtaining a state
    machine does not imply anything about the struct or behavior of it.

-   Changed: [88f947a6](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/88f947a663c14dbd41ec39eee1d8d472c38d5706) remove defensive check utilities; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-11

    Most defensive checks are replaced with `debug_assert!` embedded in Engine.
    `StoreExt` as a `RaftStorage` wrapper that implements defensive checks
    are no longer needed. `StoreExt` are mainly used for testing and it is
    very slow so that can not be used in production.

    - Remove structs: `StoreExt`, `DefensiveStoreBuilder`
    - Remove traits: `Wrapper`, `DefensiveCheckBase`, `DefensiveCheck`,

-   Changed: [eaf45dfa](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/eaf45dfa3542340fe52a9796108513637e31e521) move `RaftStateMachine` out of `RaftStorage`; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-01

    In Raft, the state machine is an independent storage component that
    operates separately from the log store. As a result, accessing the log
    store and accessing the state machine can be naturally parallelized.

    This commit replaces the type parameter `RaftStorage` in
    `Raft<.., S: RaftStorage>` with two type parameters: `RaftLogStorage` and
    `RaftStateMachine`.

    - Add: `RaftLogReaderExt` to provide additional log access methods based
      on a `RaftLogReader` implementation. Some of the methods are moved
      from `StorageHelper` to this trait.

    - Add: `Adapter` to let application use the seperated log state machine
      framework without rewriting `RaftStorage` implementation.

    - Refactor: shorten type names for the 2 example crates

    ### Upgrade tip

    Use an adapter to wrap `RaftStorage`:
    ```rust
    // Before:
    let store = MyRaftStorage::new();
    Raft::new(..., store);

    // After:
    let store = MyRaftStorage::new();
    let (log_store, sm) = Adaptoer::new(store);
    Raft::new(..., log_store, sm);
    ```

    The `RaftMetrics.replication` used to be of type
    `ReplicationMetrics{ replication: BTreeMap<NodeId, ReplicationTargetMetrics> }`
    which contained an atomic log index value for each
    ReplicationTargetMetrics stored in the `BTreeMap`. The purpose of this
    type was to reduce the cost of copying a metrics instance. However,
    since the metrics report rate has been significantly reduced, this
    cost is now negligible. As a result, these complicated implementations
    have been removed. When reporting metrics, they can simply be cloned
    from the progress information maintained by `Engine`.

    ### Upgrade tip

    Replace usage of `RaftMetrics.replication.data().replication.get(node_id)` with
    `RaftMetrics.replication.get(node_id)`.

-   Changed: [84539cb0](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/84539cb03b95ad96875b58961b2d29d9268f2f41) move snapshot type definition from storage traits to `RaftTypeConfig`; by 张炎泼; 2023-04-26

    Similar to `NodeId` or `Entry`, `SnapshotData` is also a data type that
    is specified by the application and needs to be defined in
    `RaftTypeConfig`, which is a collection of all application types.

    Public types changes:

    - Add `SnapshotData` to `RaftTypeConfig`:
      ```rust
      pub trait RaftTypeConfig {
          /// ...
          type SnapshotData: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + AsyncSeek + Send + Sync + Unpin + 'static;
      }
      ```
    - Remove associated type `SnapshotData` from `storage::RaftStorage`.
    - Remove associated type `SnapshotData` from `storage::v2::RaftStateMachine`.

    Corresponding API changes:

    - Change `storage::RaftSnapshotBuilder<C: RaftTypeConfig, SNAPSHOT_DATA>` to `RaftSnapshotBuilder<C>`
    - Change `storage::Snapshot<NID: NodeId, N: Node, SNAPSHOT_DATA>` to `storage::Snapshot<C>`

    Upgrade tip:

    Update generic type parameter in application types to pass compilation.

    Upgrade tip:

    Do not use it.
