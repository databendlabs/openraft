-   Changed: [954c67a9](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/954c67a9dadadb5f8a02f192f1b83c7906ea1e85) InstallSnapshotRequest: merge last_included{term,index} into last_included; by drdr xp; 2021-07-08

-   Changed: [933e0b32](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/933e0b32822784957c5629f7d0ed3257b281f011) use snapshot-id to identify a snapshot stream; by drdr xp; 2021-07-09

    A snapshot stream should be identified by some id, since the server end
    should not assume messages are arrived in the correct order.
    Without an id, two `install_snapshot` request belonging to different
    snapshot data may corrupt the snapshot data, explicitly or even worse,
    silently.

    - Add SnapshotId to identify a snapshot stream.

    - Add SnapshotSegmentId to identify a segment in a snapshot stream.

    - Add field `snapshot_id` to snapshot related data structures.

    - Add error `RaftError::SnapshotMismatch`.

    - `Storage::create_snapshot()` does not need to return and id.
      Since the receiving end only keeps one snapshot stream session at
      most.
      Instead, `Storage::do_log_compaction()` should build a unique id
      everytime it is called.

    - When the raft node receives an `install_snapshot` request, the id must
      match to continue.
      A request with a different id should be rejected.
      A new id with offset=0 indicates the sender has started a new stream.
      In this case, the old unfinished stream is dropped and cleaned.

    - Add test for `install_snapshot` API.

    Also `SnapshotUpdate::SnapshotComplete` now contains an LogId instead of an u64 index.

### Added:

-   Added: [8e0b0df9](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/8e0b0df9f00787feb8315e9dae14aca94494a50f) report snapshot metrics to RaftMetrics::snapshot, which is a LogId: (term, index) that a snapshot includes; by drdr xp; 2021-07-09

    - Add: `Wait.snapshot()` to watch snapshot changes.
    - Test: replace `sleep()` with `wait_for_snapshot()` to speed up tests.
