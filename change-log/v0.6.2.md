### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [4d58a51e](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/4d58a51e41189acba06c1d2a0e8466759d9eb785) a non-voter not in joint config should not block replication; by drdr xp; 2021-08-31

-   Fixed: [eed681d5](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/eed681d57950fc58b6ca71a45814b8f6d2bb1223) race condition of concurrent snapshot-install and apply.; by drdr xp; 2021-09-01

    Problem:

    Concurrent snapshot-install and apply mess up `last_applied`.

    `finalize_snapshot_installation` runs in the `RaftCore` thread.
    `apply_to_state_machine` runs in a separate tokio task(thread).

    Thus there is chance the `last_applied` being reset to a previous value:

    - `apply_to_state_machine` is called and finished in a thread.

    - `finalize_snapshot_installation` is called in `RaftCore` thread and
      finished with `last_applied` updated.

    - `RaftCore` thread finished waiting for `apply_to_state_machine`, and
      updated `last_applied` to a previous value.

    ```
    RaftCore: -.    install-snapshot,         .-> replicate_to_sm_handle.next(),
               |    update last_applied=5     |   update last_applied=2
               |                              |
               v                              |
    task:      apply 2------------------------'
    --------------------------------------------------------------------> time
    ```

    Solution:

    Rule: All changes to state machine must be serialized.

    A temporary simple solution for now is to call all methods that modify state
    machine in `RaftCore` thread.
    But this way it blocks `RaftCore` thread.

    A better way is to move all tasks that modifies state machine to a
    standalone thread, and send update request back to `RaftCore` to update
    its fields such as `last_applied`

    A log `{term:2, index:1}` is definitely greater than log `{term:1, index:2}` in raft spec.
    Comparing log id in the way of `term1 >= term2 && index1 >= index2` blocks election:
    no one can become a leader.

    - Change: MembershipConfig support more than 2 configs

    - Makes fields in MembershipConfig privates.
      Provides methods to manipulate membership.

    - Fix: commit without replication only when membership contains only one
      node. Previously it just checks the first config, which results in
      data loss if the cluster is in a joint config.

    - Fix: when starting up, count all nodes but not only the nodes in the
      first config to decide if it is a single node cluster.

### Changed:

-   Changed: [deda6d76](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/deda6d7677d2cb866184b316ae29077fe0bc3865) remove PurgedMarker. keep logs clean; by drdr xp; 2021-09-09

    Changing log(add a PurgedMarker(original SnapshotPointer)) makes it
    diffeicult to impl `install-snapshot` for a RaftStore without a lock
    protecting both logs and state machine.

    Adding a PurgedMarker and installing the snapshot has to be atomic in
    storage layer. But usually logs and state machine are separated store.
    e.g., logs are stored in fast flash disk and state machine is stored
    some where else.

    To get rid of the big lock, PurgedMarker is removed and installing a
    snaphost does not need to keep consistent with logs any more.

    `StorageError` is an `enum` of DefensiveError and StorageIOError.
    An error a RaftStorage impl returns could be a defensive check error
    or an actual io operation error.

    Why:

    anyhow::Error is not enough to support the flow control in RaftCore.
    It is typeless thus RaftCore cannot decide what next to do
    depending on the returned error.

    Inside raft, anyhow::Error should never be used, although it could be used as
    `source()` of some other error types.

-   Changed: [46bb3b1c](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/46bb3b1c323da7b5b6a3b476d7ab26ffde835706) `RaftStorage::finalize_snapshot_installation` is no more responsible to delete logs included in snapshot; by drdr xp; 2021-09-13

    A RaftStorage should be as simple and intuitive as possible.

    One should be able to correctly impl a RaftStorage without reading the
    guide but just by guessing what a trait method should do.

    RaftCore is able to do the job of deleting logs that are included in
    the state machine, RaftStorage should just do what is asked.

    - Change: if leadership is lost, the cluster is left with the **joint**
      config.
      One does not receive response of the change-membership request should
      always re-send to ensure membership config is applied.

    - Change: remove joint-uniform logic from RaftCore, which brings a lot
      complexity to raft impl. This logic is now done in Raft(which is a
      shell to control RaftCore).

    - Change: RaftCore.membership is changed to `ActiveMembership`, which
      includes a log id and a membership config.
      Making this change to let raft be able to check if a membership is
      committed by comparing the log index and its committed index.

    - Change: when adding a existent non-voter, it returns an `Ok` value
      instead of an `Err`.

    - Change: add arg `blocking` to `add_non_voter` and `change_membership`.
      A blocking `change_membership` still wait for the two config change
      log to commit.
      `blocking` only indicates if to wait for replication to non-voter to
      be up to date.

    - Change: remove `non_voters`. Merge it into `nodes`.
      Now both voters and non-voters share the same replication handle.

    - Change: remove field `ReplicationState.is_ready_to_join`, it
      can be just calculated when needed.

    - Change: remove `is_stepping_down`, `membership.contains()` is quite
      enough.

    - Change: remove `consensus_state`.

-   Changed: [df684131](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/df684131d1f6e60e611c37310f3ccbd693c5cadb) bsearch to find matching log between leader and follower; by drdr xp; 2021-12-17

    - Refactor: simplify algo to find matching log between leader and follower.
      It adopts a binary-search like algo:

      The leader tracks the max matched log id(`self.matched`) and the least unmatched log id(`self.max_possible_matched_index`).

      The follower just responds if the `prev_log_id` in

      AppendEntriesRequest matches the log at `prev_log_id.index` in its
      store.

      Remove the case-by-case algo.

    - Change: RaftStorage adds 2 new API: `try_get_log_entries()`,
      `first_id_in_log()` and `first_known_log_id()`.

      These a are not stable, may be removed soon.

    - Fix: the timeout for `Wait()` should be a total timeout. Otherwise a
      `Wait()` never quits.

    - Fix: when send append-entries request, if a log is not found, it
      should retry loading, but not enter snapshot state.
      Because a log may be deleted by RaftCore just after Replication read
      `prev_log_id` from the store.

    - Refactor: The two replication loop: line-rate loop and snapshot loop
      should not change the `ReplicationState`, but instead returning an
      error.
      Otherwise it has to check the state everywhere.

    - Refactor: simplify receiving RaftCore messages: split
      `drain_raft_rx()` into `process_raft_event()` and
      `try_drain_raft_rx()`.

    - Feature: a store impl has to add an initial log at index 0 to make the
      store mathematics complete.

    - Feature: add `ReplicationError` to describe all errors that is
      emitted when replicating entries or snapshot.

    - Defensive checks in `MemStore` are moved out into a trait
      `DefensiveCheck`.

    - Let user impl a base `RaftStorage`. Then raft wraps it with a
      `StoreExt` thus the defensive checks apply to every impl of
      `RaftStorage`.
