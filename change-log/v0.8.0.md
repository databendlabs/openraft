    When a Candidate saw a higher vote, it store it at once.
    Then no more further granted votes are valid to this candidate,
    because vote they granted are changed.

    Thus it was wrong to compare `last_log_id` before deciding if to revert to
    Follower.
    The right way is to revert to Follower at once and stop the voting
    procedure.

    When waiting for a newly added learner to become up to date,
    it tries to compare last-log-id and the reported `matched` replication
    state.
    But the `matched` may have not yet receive any update and is
    uninitialized, in such case, it tries to create a temp LogId with
    `leader_id(0, 0)`, which is illegal.

    The fix is simple: do not use log-id. Just calculating replication lag by log index.

    when handling append-entries, if `prev_log_id` is purged, it
    should not treat it as a **conflict** log and should not delete any
    log.

    This bug is caused by using `committed` as `last_applied`.
    `committed` may be smaller than `last_applied` when a follower just
    starts up.

    The solution is merging `committed` and `last_applied` into one field:
    `committed`, which is always greater than or equal the actually
    committed(applied).

    Problem:

    Error occurs after calling `change_membership()`: `assertion failed: value > prev`,
    when changing membership by converting a learner to a voter.

    Because the replication streams are re-spawned, thus progress reverts to
    zero. Then a reverted progress causes the panic.

    Solution:

    When re-spawning replications, remember the previous progress.

    When a membership that removes the leader is committed,
    the leader continue to work for a short while before reverting to a learner.
    This way, let the leader replicate the `membership-log-is-committed` message to followers.

    Otherwise, if the leader step down at once, the follower might have to re-commit the membership log
    again.

    After committing the membership log that does not contain the leader,
    the leader will step down in the next `tick`.

    - Fix: `last_purged_log_id` should be `None`, but not `LogId{index=0,
      ..}` when raft startup with a store with log at index 0.

      This is fixed by adding another field `next_purge` to distinguish
      `last_purged_log_id` value `None` and `LogId{index=0, ..}`, because
      `RaftState.log_ids` stores `LogId` but not `Option<LogId>`.

    - Add a wrapper `Valid<RaftState>` of `RaftState` to check if the state
      is valid every time accessing it. This check is done only when
      `debug_assertions` is turned on.

    Previously, when adding a learner to a Raft cluster, the last membership was not
    always marked as committed, which could cause issues when a follower tried to
    truncate logs by reverting to the last committed membership. To prevent this
    issue, we have updated the code to ensure the last membership is committed when
    adding a learner.

    In addition to this fix, we have also made several refactoring changes,
    including refining method names for trait `Coherent`, renaming
    `Membership::next_safe()` to `next_coherent()` for consistency, and updating
    enum `ChangeMembers` to include more variants for adding and removing learners.
    We have also removed `RaftCore::add_learner()` in favor of using
    `change_membership()` for all membership operations, and added a `ChangeHandler`
    to build new membership configurations for change-membership requests.

    Finally, we have updated the `Membership` API with a new method `new_with_nodes()`
    for building a new membership configuration, and moved the validation check
    out into a separate function, `ensure_valid()`. Validation is now done only
    when needed.

    Before this commit, when membership changes, e.g., from a joint config
    `[(1,2,3), (3,4,5)]` to uniform config `[3,4,5]`(assuming the leader is
    `3`), the leader stops replication to `1,2` when `[3,4,5]` is
    committed.

    This is an unnecessarily complicated solution.
    It is OK for the leader to stop replication to `1,2` as soon as config `[3,4,5]` is seen, instead of when config `[3,4,5]` is committed.

    - If the leader(`3`) finally committed `[3,4,5]`, it will eventually stop replication to `1,2`.
    - If the leader(`3`) crashes before committing `[3,4,5]`:
      - And a new leader sees the membership config log `[3,4,5]`, it will continue to commit it and finally stop replication to `1,2`.
      - Or a new leader does not see membership config log `[3,4,5]`, it will re-establish replication to `1,2`.

    In any case, stopping replication at once is OK.

    One of the considerations about this modification is:
    The nodes, e.g., `1,2` do not know they have been removed from the cluster:

    - Removed node will enter the candidate state and keeps increasing its term and electing itself.
      This won't affect the working cluster:

      - The nodes in the working cluster have greater logs; thus, the election will never succeed.

      - The leader won't try to communicate with the removed nodes thus it won't see their higher `term`.

    - Removed nodes should be shut down finally. No matter whether the
      leader replicates the membership without these removed nodes to them,
      there should always be an external process that shuts them down.
      Because there is no guarantee that a removed node can receive the
      membership log in a finite time.

    Changes:

    - Change: remove config `remove_replication`, since replication will
      be removed at once.

    - Refactor: Engine outputs `Command::UpdateReplicationStream` to inform
      the Runtime to update replication, when membership changes.

    - Refactor: remove `ReplicationState.failures`, replication does not
      need count failures to remove it.

    - Refactor: remove `ReplicationState.matched`: the **matched** log id
      has been tracked by `Engine.state.leader.progress`.

    Remove struct `ClientWriteRequest`.
    `ClientWriteRequest` is barely a wrapper that does not provide any
    additional function.

    `Raft::client_write(ClientWriteRequest)` is changed to
    `Raft::client_write(app_data: D)`, where `D` is application defined
    `AppData` implementation.

    Change `ErrorSubject::Snapshot(SnapshotMeta)` to `ErrorSubject::Snapshot(SnapshotSignature)`.

    `SnapshotSignature` is the same as `SnapshotMeta` except it does not include
    `Membership` information.
    This way errors do not have to depend on type `Node`, which is used in
    `Membership` and it is a application specific type.

    Then when a user-defined generic type `NodeData` is introduced, error
    types do not need to change.

    Structs that depend on `Node` now have to implement `trait Node`,  or use a predefined basic implementation `BasicNode`. E.g., `struct Membership` now has two type parameters: `impl<NID, N> Membership<NID, N> where N: Node, NID: NodeId`.

    Before this commit, the value of `Membership.nodes` is `Option<N:
    Node>`: `Membership.nodes: BTreeMap<NID, Option<N>>`

    The value does not have to be an `Option`.
    If an application does not need openraft to store the `Node` data, it
    can just implement `trait Node` with an empty struct, or just use
    `BasicNode` as a placeholder.

    - Using `Option<N>` as the value is a legacy and since #480 is merged, we
      do not need the `Option` any more.

    `SnapshotMeta.last_log_id` should be the same type as
    `StateMachine.last_applied`.

    By making `SnapshotMeta.last_log_id` an Option of LogId, a snapshot can
    be build on an empty state-machine(in which `last_applied` is None).

    Let `snapshot+logs` be a complete state of a raft node.

    The Assumption before is `state_machine+logs` is a complete state of a
    raft node. This requires state machine to persist the state every time
    applying a log, which would be an innecessary overhead.

    - Change: remove ENV config entries. Do not let a lib be affected by
      environment variables.

    - Change: remove `Config.keep_unsnapshoted_log`: now by default, logs
      not included in snapshot won't be deleted.

      Rename `Config.max_applied_log_to_keep` to `max_in_snapshot_log_to_keep`.

    A node is stored in `Membership` thus it should always be found.
    Otherwise it is a bug of openraft.
    In either case, there is no need for an application to deal with
    `RPCError::NodeNotFound` error.

    An application that needs such an error should define it as an
    application error.

    Add `RaftError<E>` as error type returned by every `Raft::xxx()` API.
    RaftError has two variants: Fatal error or API specific error.
    This way every API error such as AppendEntriesError does not have to include
    an `Fatal` in it.

    Upgrade tip:

    The affected types is mainly `trait RaftNetwork`, an application should
    replace AppendEntriesError, VoteError, InstallSnapshotError with
    `RaftError<_>`, `RaftError<_>`, and `RaftError<_, InstallSnapshotError>`.

    So is for other parts, e.g., `Raft::append_entries()` now returns
    `Result<AppendEntriesResponse, RaftError<_>>`, an application should
    also rewrite error handling that calls these APIs.

    See changes in examples/.

    `RaftNetworkFactory::new_client()` does not return an error because
    openraft can only ignore it.  Therefore it should **not** create a
    connection but rather a client that will connect when required.  Thus
    there is chance it will build a client that is unable to send out
    anything, e.g., in case the Node network address is configured
    incorrectly.

    Because of the above change, And `AddLearnerError` will not include a
    NetworkError any more, because when adding a learner, the connectivity
    can not be effectively detected.

    Upgrade tip:

    Just update the application network implementation so that it compiles.

    In openraft adds a learner is done by committing a membership config
    log, which is almost the same as committing any log.

    `AddLearnerResponse` contains a field `matched` to indicate the
    replication state to the learner, which is not included in
    `ClientWriteResponse`. This information can be retrieved via
    `Raft::metrics()`.

    Therefore to keep the API simple, replace `AddLearnerResponse` with
    `ClientWriteResponse`.

    Behavior change: adding a learner always commit a new membership config
    log, no matter if it already exists in membership.
    To avoid duplicated add, an application should check existence first by
    examining `Raft::metrics()`

    - Fix: #679

    Upgrade tips:

    - Replace AddLearnerResponse with ClientWriteResponse
    - Replace AddLearnerError with ClientWriteError

    Passes the application compilation.

    When changing membership in nonblocking mode, the leader submits a
    membership config log but does not wait for the log to be committed.

    This is useless because the caller has to assert the log is
    committed, by periodically querying the metrics of a raft node, until it
    is finally committed. Which actually makes it a blocking routine.

    API changes:

    - Removes `allow_lagging` parameter from `Raft::change_membership()`
    - Removes error `LearnerIsLagging`

    Upgrade tip:

    Adjust API calls to make it compile.

    `trait IntoNodes` converts types `T` such as `Vec` or `BTreeSet` into
    `BTreeMap<NID, Node>`.

    This patch changes the functionality of the `IntoNodes` trait to provide
    two new methods `has_nodes()` and `node_ids()`, in addition to the existing
    `into_nodes()` method. The `has_nodes()` method returns true if the type `T`
    contains any `Node` objects, and `node_ids()` returns a `Vec` of the `NodeId`
    objects associated with the `Node` objects in `T`.

    Refactor:

    The patch also refactors the `Membership::next_safe()` method to return an
    `Err(LearnerNotFound)` if it attempts to build a `Membership` object
    containing a `voter_id` that does not correspond to any `Node`.

    Function `get_log_entries()` and `try_get_log_entry()` are provided by
    trait `RaftLogReader` with default implementations. However, they do not
    need to be part of this trait and an application does not have to
    implement them.

    Therefore in this patch they are moved to `StorageHelper` struct, which
    provides additional storage access methods that are built based on the
    `RaftStorage` trait.

-   Changed: [0a1dd3d6](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/commit/0a1dd3d69557f412f7e8ecd5b903408308090a96) replace EffectiveMembership with StoredMembership in RaftStorage; by 张炎泼; 2023-02-26

    `EffectiveMembership` is a struct used at runtime, which contains
    additional information such as an optimized `QuorumSet` implementation
    that has different structure from a `Membership`.

    To better separate concerns, a new struct called `StoredMembership` has
    been introduced specifically for storage purpose. It contains only the
    information that needs to be stored in storage. Therefore,
    `StoredMembership` is used instead of `EffectiveMembership` in
    RaftStorage.

    Upgrade tip:

    Replace `EffectiveMembership` with `StoredMembership` in an application.

    Fields in `EffectiveMembership` are made private and can be accessed via
    corresponding methods such as: `EffectiveMembership.log_id` and
    `EffectiveMembership.membership` should be replaced with
    `EffectiveMembership::log_id()` and `EffectiveMembership::membership()`.

    * Feature: use blank log for heartbeat

    Heartbeat in standard raft is the way for a leader to assert it is still alive.
    - A leader send heartbeat at a regular interval.
    - A follower that receives a heartbeat believes there is an active leader thus it rejects election request(`send_vote`) from another node unreachable to the leader, for a short period.

    Openraft heartbeat is a blank log

    Such a heartbeat mechanism depends on clock time.
    But raft as a distributed consensus already has its own **pseudo time** defined very well.
    The **pseudo time** in openraft is a tuple `(vote, last_log_id)`, compared in dictionary order.

    Why it works

    To refuse the election by a node that does not receive recent messages from the current leader,
    just let the active leader send a **blank log** to increase the **pseudo time** on a quorum.

    Because the leader must have the greatest **pseudo time**,
    thus by comparing the **pseudo time**, a follower automatically refuse election request from a node unreachable to the leader.

    And comparing the **pseudo time** is already done by `handle_vote_request()`,
    there is no need to add another timer for the active leader.

    Other changes:

    - Feature: add API to switch timeout based events:
      - `Raft::enable_tick()`: switch on/off election and heartbeat.
      - `Raft::enable_heartbeat()`: switch on/off heartbeat.
      - `Raft::enable_elect()`: switch on/off election.

      These methods make some testing codes easier to write.
      The corresponding `Config` entries are also added:
      `Config::enable_tick`
      `Config::enable_heartbeat`
      `Config::enable_elect`

    - Refactor: remove Engine `Command::RejectElection`.
      Rejecting election now is part of `handle_vote_req()` as blank-log
      heartbeat is introduced.

    - Refactor: heartbeat is removed from `ReplicationCore`.
      Instead, heartbeat is emitted by `RaftCore`.

    - Fix: when failed to sending append-entries, do not clear
      `need_to_replicate` flag.

    - CI: add test with higher network delay.

    - Doc: explain why using blank log as heartbeat.

    With this feature on: only one leader can be elected in each term, but
    reduce LogId size from `LogId:{term, node_id, index}` to `LogId{term, index}`.

    Add `CommittedLeaderId` as the leader-id type used in `LogId`:
    The leader-id used in `LogId` can be different(smaller) from leader-id used
    in `Vote`, depending on `LeaderId` definition.
    `CommittedLeaderId` is the smallest data that can identify a leader
    after the leadership is granted by a quorum(committed).

    Change: Vote stores a LeaderId in it.

    ```rust
    // Before
    pub struct Vote<NID> {
        pub term: u64,
        pub node_id: NID,
        pub committed: bool,
    }

    pub struct Vote<NID> {
        #[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", serde(flatten))]
        pub leader_id: LeaderId<NID>,

        pub committed: bool,
    }
    ```

    Upgrade tip:

    If you manually serialize `Vote`, i.e. without using
    `serde`, the serialization part should be rewritten.
