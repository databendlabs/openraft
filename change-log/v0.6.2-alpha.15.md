    Use SnapshotPointer to store membership is a bad idea.
    It brings in troubles proving the consistency, e.g.:

    - When concurrent `do_log_compaction()` is called(it is not
      possible for now, may be possible in future. The correctness proof
      involving multiple component is a nightmare.)

    - Proof of correctness of consistency between
      `StateMachine.last_membership` and `SnapshotPointer.membership` is
      complicated.

    What we need is actually:
    - At least one committed log is left in the log storage,
    - and info in the purged log must be present in the state machine, e.g.
      membership
