### Changed:

-   Changed: [6098f5cf](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/6098f5cf61b074c8fccecf722278183c3ee5cd27) add AsyncRuntime type parameter to RaftTypeConfig (#869); by wvwwvwwv; 2023-06-21

    -   Add AsyncRuntime type parameter to RaftTypeConfig

        This commit introduces the AsyncRuntime type parameter to
        RaftTypeConfig, allowing applications to choose their preferred
        asynchronous runtime, such as tokio or async-std.

    -   Parameterize Instant type for flexibility with async runtimes

        To create a more flexible interface between the crate and
        asynchronous runtimes, the Instant type is now associated with the
        async runtime. This is because Instant::now can have different
        implementations. This commit adds the trait Instant and TokioInstant
        for representing system states.

    - Fix: #741

-   Changed: [4c488a61](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/4c488a61da8fee614294dea107fdbf0faf15cd28) move external command trigger to dedicated Trigger struct (#888); by 张炎泼; 2023-07-01

    * Refactor: move RaftTypeConfig to separate file

    * Change: move external command trigger to dedicated Trigger struct

    Moved trigger election, heartbeat, snapshot and purge log from `Raft`
    to a new `Trigger` struct, to separate externally trigger actions from
    the main Raft API.

    ---

    Marked the old trigger methods in `Raft` as deprecated, and recommended
    using the new `Trigger` struct instead.

    The main motivation of these changes is to organize the Raft API in a
    more structured way, by extracting trigger actions into a dedicated
    struct, instead of mixing them together in the `Raft` API.

-   Changed: [8a81df53](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/8a81df532e45a7dec2e9c6820f654bdc44dccd46) `RaftLogReaderExt::get_log_id()` should not return last-purged-id; by 张炎泼; 2023-07-02

    `get_log_id()` should only return present log id,
    and should not be responsible to return id of an already purged log
    entry, which introduce unnecessary complexity.

    Upgrade tip:

    An RaftStorage implementation should have already maintained the
    last-purge-log-id. Avoid getting it via `RaftLogReaderExt::get_log_id()`.

-   Changed: [330b1fff](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/330b1fff7d14fee39f58667db2087de5c3701af1) move `get_log_state()` from RaftLogReader to RaftStorage; by 张炎泼; 2023-07-03

    - Move the `get_log_state()` method from the `RaftLogReader` trait to
      the `RaftStorage` trait.

    - For applications that enable the `storage-v2` feature,
      `get_log_state()` will be moved from `RaftLogReader` to
      `RaftLogStorage`.

    - `get_log_state()` should only be called once when openraft starts up.
      Only the `ReplicationCore` uses `RaftLogReader`, and it does not need
      `get_log_state()`. The log entries to replicate are decided by
      `RaftCore`.

    Upgrade tip:

    Implement `get_log_state()` in the `RaftStorage` or `RaftLogStorage`
    trait instead of `RaftLogReader`.

    Refer to the changes in `rocksstore/src/lib.rs` in this commit for an
    example.

-   Changed: [87c0d74f](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/87c0d74fb4941a87e7aaeb8961e0f9381d637eb9) remove `N, LS, SM` from `Raft<C, N, LS, SM>`; by 张炎泼; 2023-11-20

    - `Raft<C, ..>`: is a control handle of `RaftCore` and it does not directly
      rely on `N: RaftNetworkFactory`, `LS: RaftLogStorage` and
      `SM: RaftStateMachine`.
      Thus these types should not be part of `Raft`.

      In this commit, we remove `N, LS, SM` from `Raft<C, N, LS, SM>`,
      `RaftInner<C, N, LS>` and `RaftMsg<C, N, LS>`.
      Type `N, LS, SM` now are only used by `Raft::new()` which needs these
      types to create `RaftCore`.

    - `Raft::external_request()`: Another change is the signature of the
      `Fn` passed to `Raft::external_request()` changes from
      `FnOnce(&RaftState, &mut LS, &mut N)` to `FnOnce(&RaftState)`.

    - Fix: the `FnOnce` passed to `Raft::external_request()` should always
      be `Send`, unoptionally. Because it is used to send from `Raft` to
      `RaftCore`.

    - Fix: #939

-   Added: [d629dbeb](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/d629dbeb65f73e3133e548fe48deb6a645f0dd5a) add ChangeMembers::SetNodes (#876); by 张炎泼; 2023-06-22

    During dynamic cluster changes, we sometimes need to update an existing
    node, for example changing its network address.

    Adding `SetNodes` variant to `ChangeMembers` allows replacing an
    existing node directly.
    However, this also carries risk of creating a split brain scenario if
    used incorrectly.

    - Fix: #875

-   Added: [104983db](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/104983db6bf5a60cd28e0b7237bfd2937a50168a) add 'singlethreaded' raft mode (#878); by wvwwvwwv; 2023-06-27

    * Feature: add 'singlethreaded' raft mode

    - 'singlethreaded' compile-time feature gate.

    The new feature gate forces the raft instance to be used by a single thread by not implementing `Send` for certain data structures and substituting calls to `tokio::spawn` with `tokio::spawn_local` when using the `tokio` asynchronous runtime.

    - Re-export `add_async_trait` for application to define a `!Send` async trait.

    - Fix: #862

-   Added: [942ec78b](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/942ec78bc367665ce82516ad3458e479d895b0ea) save committed log id; by 张炎泼; 2023-07-16

    - **Wrote committed log id to storage**
      Save the committed log id to storage before Raft apply log entries. This can
      recover state machine to the state corresponding to the committed log id upon
      system startup.

    - **Re-applied log entries after startup**
      If the last applied log id is smaller than the committed log id saved in
      storage, re-apply log entries from the next index of last applied log id to the
      committed log id.

    Version 1 storage API `RaftStorage` and Version 2 storage API
    `RaftLogStorage` both add API `save_committed()` and `read_committed()`
    to support saving/reading committed log id.

    These two new API are optional and provides default dummy
    implementation, an application does not need any modifications if it
    does not need this feature.

-   Added: [6d42c6e2](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/6d42c6e24c3bc752ffcaa331df48b5a41eb763b7) permit follower log to revert to earlier state with `--features loosen-follower-log-revert`; by 张炎泼; 2023-07-20

    Add a new feature flag `loosen-follower-log-revert`, to permit the
    follower's log to roll back to an earlier state without causing the
    leader to panic.

    Although log state reversion is typically seen as a bug, enabling it can
    be useful for testing or in some special scenarios.
    For instance, in an even number nodes cluster, erasing a node's data
    and then rebooting it(log reverts to empty) will not result in data
    loss.

    If a `RaftNetwork` implmentation found an `AppendEntriesRequest` is too
    large, it could return a `PayloadTooLarge::new_entries_hint(n)` error to
    tell openraft devide request into smaller chunks containing at most `n`
    entries. Openraft will limit the number of entries in the next 10
    `AppendEntrie` RPC.

    Exmaple:

    ```rust
    impl<C: RaftTypeConfig> RaftNetwork<C> for MyNetwork {
        fn append_entries(&self,
                rpc: AppendEntriesRequest<C>,
                option: RPCOption
        ) -> Result<_, RPCError<C::NodeId, C::Node, RaftError<C::NodeId>>> {
            if rpc.entries.len() > 10 {
                return Err(PayloadTooLarge::new_entries_hint(10).into());
            }
            // ...
        }
    }

    This new method serves as a convenience wrapper around

    value needs to be returned.

    Add `log_index()`, `log_index_at_least()`, `applied_index()` and
    `applied_index_at_least()` to `openraft::metrics::Wait` to replace
    `Wait::log()` and `Wait::log_at_least()`.

    These two methods are deprecated since `0.9.0` because the names does
    not imply that they will be blocked by `last_applied` log index.

    The `Raft::is_leader()` method does not fully ensure linearizable read
    operations and is deprecated in this version. Instead, applications
    should use the `Raft::ensure_linearizable()` method to guarantee
    linearizability.

    Under the hood, `Raft::ensure_linearizable()` obtains a `ReadIndex` from
    `RaftCore` if it remains the leader, and blocks until the state
    machine applies up to the `ReadIndex`. This process ensures that the
    application observes all state visible to a preceding read operation.

    - Fix: #965

    Upgrade tip:

    Replace `Raft::is_leader()` with `Raft::ensure_linearizable()`.

    Using this method, the application provides a full snapshot to
    Openraft, which is then used to install and replace the state machine.
    It is entirely the responsibility of the application to acquire a
    snapshot through any means: be it in chunks, as a stream, or via shared
    storage solutions like S3.

    This method necessitates that the caller supplies a valid `Vote` to
    confirm the legitimacy of the leader, mirroring the requirements of
    other Raft protocol APIs such as `append_entries` and `vote`.

    `Raft::begin_receiving_snapshot()` request the state machine to return a
    `SnapshotData` for receiving snapshot from the leader.
    Internally it calls `RaftStateMachine::begin_receiving_snapshot()`

    Handling snapshot receiving is moved out of state-machine worker task.
    Now it is in implemented outside the `RaftCore`.
    Receiving snapshot could be totally application specific and should not
    be part of Openraft.

    The in sm-worker snapshot receiving is removed.

-   Added: [687fcf2f](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/687fcf2f7cc0fed878f7a5b9ac96fe63ef793099) `RaftNetwork::full_snapshot()` to send a complete snapshot; by 张炎泼; 2024-02-11

    Add `RaftNetwork::snapshot()` to send a complete snapshot and move
    sending snapshot by chunks out of ReplicationCore.

    To enable a fully customizable implementation of snapshot transmission
    tailored to the application's needs, this commit relocates the
    chunk-by-chunk transmission logic from `ReplicationCore` to a new
    sub mod, `crate::network::snapshot_transport`.

    The `snapshot_transport` mod provides a default chunk-based snapshot
    transmission mechanism, which can be overridden by creating a custom
    implementation of the `RaftNetwork::full_snapshot()` method. As part of this
    commit, `RaftNetwork::full_snapshot()` simply delegates to `snapshot_transport`.
    Developers may use `snapshot_transport` as a reference when implementing
    their own snapshot transmission strategy.

    Snapshot transmission is internally divided into two distinct phases:

    1. Upon request for snapshot transmission, `ReplicationCore` initiates a
       new task `RaftNetwork::full_snapshot()` dedicated to sending a complete
       `Snapshot`. This task should be able to be terminated gracefully by
       subscribing the `cancel` future.

    2. Once the snapshot has been fully transmitted by
       `RaftNetwork::full_snapshot()`, the task signals an event back to
       `ReplicationCore`. Subsequently, `ReplicationCore` informs `RaftCore`
       of the event, allowing it to acknowledge the completion of the
       snapshot transmission.

    Other changes:

    - `ReplicationCore` has two `RaftNetwork`s, one for log replication and
      heartbeat, the other for snapshot only.

    - `ReplicationClosed` becomes a public error for notifying the
      application implemented sender that a snapshot replication is
      canceled.

    - `StreamingError` is introduced as a container of errors that may occur
      in application defined snapshot transmission, including local IO
      error, network errors, errors returned by remote peer and `ReplicationClosed`.

    - The `SnapshotResponse` type is introduced to differentiate it from the
      `InstallSnapshotResponse`, which is used for chunk-based responses.

-   Added: [907f5f74](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/907f5f7494f073a6d1a844cf4ef05d314d76d7a8) feature flag `generic-snapshot-data`; by 张炎泼; 2024-02-16

    Add feature flag `generic-snapshot-data`: when enabled, `SnapshotData`
    does not have `AsyncSeek + AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` bound.
    This enables application to define their own snapshot format and
    transmission protocol.

    If this feature flag is not eabled, no changes are required for
    application to upgrade Openraft.

    On the sending end(leader that sends snapshot to follower):

    - Without `generic-snapshot-data`: `RaftNetwork::snapshot()`
      provides a default implementation that invokes the chunk based API
      `RaftNetwork::install_snapshot()` for transmit.

    - With `generic-snapshot-data` enabled: `RaftNetwork::snapshot()` must be
      implemented to provide application customized snapshot transmission.
      Application does not need to implement `RaftNetwork::install_snapshot()`.

    On the receiving end(follower):

    - `Raft::install_snapshot()` is available only when
      `generic-snapshot-data` is disabled.

    Add an example `examples/raft-kv-memstore-generic-snapshot-data` with
    `generic-snapshot-data` enabled.
    In this example snapshot is transmitted without fragmentation, i.e., via
    `RaftNetwork::snapshot()`. The chunk based API
    `RaftNetwork::install_snapshot()` is not used.
    In a production scenario, a snapshot can be transmitted in arbitrary
    manner.

-   Added: [884f0da6](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/884f0da65ec10ce5777165e6906c61c326f2394b) add trait `RaftLogStorageExt` to provide additional raft-log methods; by 张炎泼; 2024-03-04

    The `RaftLogReaderExt::blocking_append()` method enables the caller to
    append logs to storage in a blocking manner, eliminating the need to
    create and await a callback. This method simplifies the process of
    writing tests.

### Fixed:

-   Fixed: [86b46a08](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/86b46a08090b44511ae481fad8c32ea805ac43d2) restore replication progress when a leader starts up (#884); by 张炎泼; 2023-06-29

    As a leader, the replication progress to itself should be restored upon
    startup.

    And if this leader is the only node in a cluster, it should re-apply all
    of the logs to state machine at once.

    - Fix: #883

-   Fixed: [97254a31](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/97254a31c673e52429ee7187de96fd2ea2a5ce98) Do not report `snapshot.last_log_id` to metrics until snapshot is finished building/installing; by 张炎泼; 2023-10-18

    Before this commit `RaftMetrics.snapshot` contains the last log id of a
    snapshot that is **going** to install. Therefore there is chance the
    metrics is updated but the store does not.

    In this commit, `RaftMetrics.snapshot` will only be updated when a
    snapshot is finished building or installing, by adding a new field
    `snpashot` to `IOState` for tracking persisted snapshot meta data.

    - Fix: #912

-   Fixed: [ffae5224](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/ffae522425f9a55b1ab4d6ce866d469827932627) `AsyncReadExt::read_buf()` only reads at most 2MB per call; by 张炎泼; 2023-11-08

    When streaming a snapshot chunk, it should repeatly `read_buf()` until
    `snapshot_max_chunk_size` is full or read EOF.

-   Fixed: [f41729a1](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/commit/f41729a18ec147d24a8d00021f619b517aa1bab1) End `tick_loop()` when the receiver is gone.; by Ivan Schréter; 2023-11-13

    Currently, `tick_loop()` would keep printing the trace message every
    tick even when the receiver (Raft main loop) is gone in this form:

    `INFO openraft::core::tick: .../tick.rs:70: Tick fails to send, receiving end quit: channel closed`

    If the tick message fails to send, then terminate the loop, since every
    future message will fail to send as well.

    Also adjust the trace message to better describe what happened.
