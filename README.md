ü™µü™µü™µ Raft is not yet good enough.
This project intends to improve raft as the next-generation consensus protocol for distributed data storage systems (SQL, NoSQL, KV, Streaming, Graph ... or maybe something more exotic).

Currently, openraft is the consensus engine of meta-service cluster in [databend](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend).


- **Get started**: [The guide](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft) is the best place to get started,
  followed by [the docs](https://docs.rs/openraft/latest/) for more in-depth details.

- [Openraft FAQ](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/faq) explains some common questions.

- üôå Questions? Join the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ZKw3WG7FQ9) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/discussions/new).

- Openraft is derived from [async-raft](https://docs.rs/crate/async-raft/latest) with several bugs fixed: [Fixed bugs](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/blob/main/derived-from-async-raft.md).

# Status

- **Openraft API is not stable yet**. Before `1.0.0`, an upgrade may contain incompatible changes.
  Check our [change-log](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/blob/main/change-log.md). A commit message starts with a keyword to indicate the modification type of the commit:

  - `DataChange:` on-disk data types changes, which may require manual upgrade.
  - `Change:` if it introduces incompatible changes. 
  - `Feature:` if it introduces compatible non-breaking new features.
  - `Fix:` if it just fixes a bug.

- **Branch main** has been under active development.

    The main branch is for the 0.8 release.

    - The features are almost complete for building an application.
    - The performance isn't yet fully optimized. Currently, it's about 48,000 writes per second with a single writer.
    - Unit test coverage is 91%.
    - The chaos test is not yet done.

# Roadmap

- [x] **2022-10-31** [Extended joint membership](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/extended-membership)

- [x] **2023-02-14** Minimize confliction rate when electing;
  See: [Openraft Vote design](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/vote);
  Or use standard raft mode with [feature flag `single-term-leader`](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/feature-flags).

- [x] **2023-04-26** Goal performance is 1,000,000 put/sec.

- [ ] Reduce the complexity of vote and pre-vote: [get rid of pre-vote RPC](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/discussions/15);

- [ ] Support flexible quorum, e.g.:[Hierarchical Quorums](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.9/zookeeperHierarchicalQuorums.html)

- [ ] Consider introducing read-quorum and write-quorum,
  improve efficiency with a cluster with an even number of nodes.


<!--
   - - [ ] Consider to separate log storage and log order storage.
   -   Leader only determines and replicates the index of log entries, not log
   -   payload.
      -->

# Performance

The benchmark is focused on the Openraft framework itself and is run on a
minimized store and network. This is **NOT a real world** application benchmark!!!

Benchmark history:

To access the benchmark, go to the `./cluster_benchmark` folder and run `make
bench_cluster_of_3`.

The benchmark is carried out with varying numbers of clients because:
- The `1 client` benchmark shows the average **latency** to commit each log.
- The `64 client` benchmark shows the maximum **throughput**.

The benchmark is conducted with the following settings:
- No network.
- In-memory store.
- A cluster of 3 nodes in a single process on a Mac M1-Max laptop.
- Request: empty
- Response: empty


# Features

- It is fully reactive and embraces the async ecosystem.
  It is driven by actual Raft events taking place in the system as opposed to being driven by a `tick` operation.
  Batching of messages during replication is still used whenever possible for maximum throughput.

- Storage and network integration is well defined via two traits `RaftStorage` & `RaftNetwork`.
  This provides applications maximum flexibility in being able to choose their storage and networking mediums.

- All interaction with the Raft node is well defined via a single public `Raft` type, which is used to spawn the Raft async task, and to interact with that task.
  The API for this system is clear and concise.

- Log replication is fully pipelined and batched for optimal performance.
  Log replication also uses a congestion control mechanism to help keep nodes up-to-date as efficiently as possible.

- It fully supports dynamic cluster membership changes with joint config.
  The buggy single-step membership change algo is not considered.
  See the [`dynamic membership`](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/dynamic-membership) chapter in the guide.

- Details on initial cluster formation, and how to effectively do so from an application's perspective,
  are discussed in the [cluster formation](https://datafuselabs.github.io/openraft/cluster-formation) chapter in the guide.

- Automatic log compaction with snapshots, as well as snapshot streaming from the leader node to follower nodes is fully supported and configurable.

- The entire code base is [instrumented with tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/).
  This can be used for [standard logging](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#log-compatibility), or for [distributed tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#related-crates), and the verbosity can be [statically configured at compile time](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/level_filters/index.html) to completely remove all instrumentation below the configured level.
