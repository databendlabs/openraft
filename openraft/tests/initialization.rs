///
/// - brings 3 nodes online with only knowledge of themselves.
/// - asserts that they remain in learner state with no activity (they should be completely passive).
/// - initializes the cluster with membership config including all nodes.
/// - asserts that the cluster was able to come online, elect a leader and maintain a stable state.
/// - asserts that the leader was able to successfully commit its initial payload and that all followers have
///   successfully replicated the payload.
