# Enables benchmarks in unittest.
#
# Benchmark in openraft depends on the unstable feature `test` thus it can not be used with stable rust.

# the unstable features have to be enabled explicitly with environment variable `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`.

# Turn on this feature it allows at most ONE quorum-granted leader for each term.
# This is the way standard raft does, by making the LeaderId a partial order value.
#
# - With this feature on:
#   It is more likely to conflict during election. But every log only needs to store one `term` in it.
#
# - With this feature off:
#   Election conflict rate will be reduced, but every log has to store a `LeaderId{ term, node_id}`,
#   which may be costly if an application uses a big NodeId type.
#
# This feature is disabled by default.
