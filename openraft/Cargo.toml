# This is the way standard raft does, by making the LeaderId a partial order value.

# - With this feature on:
#   It is more likely to conflict during election. But every log only needs to store one `term` in it.

# - With this feature off:
#   Election conflict rate will be reduced, but every log has to store a `LeaderId{ term, node_id}`,
#   which may be costly if an application uses a big NodeId type.
