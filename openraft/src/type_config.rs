/// Configuration of types used by the [`Raft`] core engine.
///
/// The (empty) implementation structure defines request/response types, node ID type
/// and the like. Refer to the documentation of associated types for more information.
///
/// ## Note
///
/// Since Rust cannot automatically infer traits for various inner types using this config
/// type as a parameter, this trait simply uses all the traits required for various types
/// as its supertraits as a workaround. To ease the declaration, the macro
/// `declare_raft_types` is provided, which can be used to declare the type easily.
///
/// Example:
/// ```ignore
/// openraft::declare_raft_types!(
///    pub TypeConfig:
///        D            = ClientRequest,
///        R            = ClientResponse,
///        NodeId       = u64,
///        Node         = openraft::BasicNode,
///        Entry        = openraft::Entry<TypeConfig>,
///        SnapshotData = Cursor<Vec<u8>>,
///        AsyncRuntime = openraft::TokioRuntime,
/// );
