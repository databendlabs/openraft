/// See the [network chapter of the guide](crate::docs::getting_started#4-implement-raftnetwork)
/// for details and discussion on this trait and how to implement it.
///
/// A single network instance is used to connect to a single target node. The network instance is

/// V2 network API removes `install_snapshot()` method that sends snapshot in chunks
/// and introduces `full_snapshot()` method that let application fully customize snapshot transmit.

/// implementations.
