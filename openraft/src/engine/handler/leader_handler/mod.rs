        //       won't be submitted to `RaftLogStorage` until `save_vote()` completes,
        //       which ensures consistency.
        //       ---
        //       However, when `RaftLogStorage` is moved to a separate task,
        //       `RaftCore` will communicate with `RaftLogStorage` via a channel.
        //       This change could result in `AppendLog` requests being submitted
        //       before the previous `save_vote()` request is finished.
        //       ---
        //       This scenario creates a risk where a log entry becomes visible and
        //       is replicated by `ReplicationCore` to other nodes before the vote
        //       is flushed to disk. If the vote isn't flushed and the server restarts,
        //       the vote could revert to a previous state. This could allow a new leader
        //       to be elected with a smaller vote (term), breaking consistency.
