//! # Feature flags
//!
//! - `bench`: Enables benchmarks in unittest. Benchmark in openraft depends on the unstable feature
//!   `test` thus it can not be used with stable rust. In order to run the benchmark with stable
//!   toolchain, the unstable features have to be enabled explicitly with environment variable
//!   `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`.
//!
//! - `bt`: Enable backtrace: generate backtrace for errors. This requires unstable feature
//! `error_generic_member_access` and `provide_any` thus it can not be used with stable rust.
//!
//! - `serde`: Add serde::Serialize and serde:Deserialize bound to data types. If you'd like to use
//!   `serde` to serialize messages.
//!
//! - `singlethreaded`: Prevent `Raft` instances from being shared among multiple threads.

/// A trait defining application specific data.

/// The intention of this trait is that applications which are using this crate will be able to
/// use their own concrete data types throughout their application without having to serialize and
/// deserialize their data as it goes through Raft. Instead, applications can present their data
/// models as-is to Raft, Raft will present it to the application's `RaftStorage` impl when ready,
/// and the application may then deal with the data directly in the storage engine without having
/// to do a preliminary deserialization.
///
/// ## Note

/// The trait is automatically implemented for all types which satisfy its supertraits.

/// A trait defining application specific response data.

/// The intention of this trait is that applications which are using this crate will be able to
/// use their own concrete data types for returning response data from the storage layer when an
/// entry is applied to the state machine as part of a client request (this is not used during
/// replication). This allows applications to seamlessly return application specific data from
/// their storage layer, up through Raft, and back into their application for returning
/// data to clients.
///
/// This type must encapsulate both success and error responses, as application specific logic
/// related to the success or failure of a client request — application specific validation logic,
/// enforcing of data constraints, and anything of that nature — are expressly out of the realm of
/// the Raft consensus protocol.
