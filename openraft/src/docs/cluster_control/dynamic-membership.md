# Dynamic Membership

In contrast to the original raft, openraft considers all memberships as **joint** memberships.
A uniform config is simply a specific case of joint: the combination of only one config.

Openraft provides the following mechanisms for managing member node lifecycles:


## Membership API

### [`Raft::add_learner(node_id, node, blocking)`][`Raft::add_learner()`]

This method adds a learner to the cluster,
and immediately starts synchronizing logs from the leader.

- A **Learner** does not vote for leadership.


### [`Raft::change_membership(members, retain)`][`Raft::change_membership()`]

This method initiates a membership change and returns when the proposed
membership is effective and committed.

If there are nodes in the given membership that are not `Learners`, this method will fail.
Therefore, the application should always call [`Raft::add_learner()`] first.

Once the new membership is committed, a `Voter` not in the new config is removed if `retain=false`,
otherwise, it is converted to a `Learner` if `retain=true`.


#### Example of using `retain`

Given the original membership as `{"members":{1,2,3}, "learners":{}}`,
call `change_membership` with `members={3,4,5}`, then:

- If `retain=true`,  the new membership is `{"members":{3,4,5}, "learners":{1,2}}`.
- If `retain=false`, the new membership is `{"members":{3,4,5}, "learners":{}}`.


## Add a new node as a `Voter`

To add a new node as a `Voter`:
- First, add it as a `Learner`(non-voter) with [`Raft::add_learner()`].
  In this step, the leader sets up replication to the new node, but it cannot vote yet.
- Then, convert it into a `Voter` with [`Raft::change_membership()`].

```ignore
let client = ExampleClient::new(1, get_addr(1)?);

client.add_learner((2, get_addr(2)?)).await?;
client.add_learner((3, get_addr(3)?)).await?;
client.change_membership(&btreeset! {1,2,3}, true).await?;
```

A complete snippet of adding voters can be found in [Mem KV cluster example](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft/blob/d041202a9f30b704116c324a6adc4f2ec28029fa/examples/raft-kv-memstore/tests/cluster/test_cluster.rs#L75-L103).


## Remove a voter node

-   Call `Raft::change_membership()` on the leader to initiate a two-phase
    membership config change, e.g., the leader will propose two config logs:
    joint config log: `[{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}]` and then the uniform config log:
    `{3, 4, 5}`.

-   As soon as the leader commits the second config log, the node to remove can
    be safely terminated.

**Note that** An application does not have to wait for the config log to be
replicated to the node to remove. Because a distributed consensus protocol
tolerates a minority member crash.

## Update Node

To update a node, such as altering its network address,
the application calls [`Raft::change_membership()`][].
The initial argument should be set to [`ChangeMembers::SetNodes(BTreeMap<NodeId,Node>)`][`ChangeMembers::SetNodes`].

**Warning: Misusing `SetNodes` could lead to a split-brain situation**:

### Brain split

When updating node network addresses,
brain split could occur if the new address belongs to another node,
leading to two elected leaders.

Consider a 3-node cluster (`a, b, c`, with addresses `x, y, z`) and an
uninitialized node `d` with address `w`:

```text
a: x
b: y
c: z

d: w
```

Mistakenly updating `b`'s address from `y` to `w` would enable both `x, y` and `z, w` to form quorums and elect leaders:

- `c` proposes ChangeMembership: `{a:x, b:w, c:z}`;
- `c, d` grant `c`;

- `c` elects itself as leader
- `c, d` confirm `c` as leader

- `a` elects itself as leader
- `a, b` confirm `a` as leader


Directly updating node addresses with `ChangeMembers::SetNodes`
should be replaced with `ChangeMembers::RemoveNodes` and `Raft::add_learner` whenever possible.

Do not use `ChangeMembers::SetNodes` unless you know what you are doing.


### Ensure connection to the correct node

Ensure that a connection to the right node is the responsibility
of the [`RaftNetworkFactory`] and the [`RaftNetworkV2`] implementation.

Connecting to a wrong node can lead to data inconsistency and even data loss.
See: [brain split caused by wrong node address][`docs::brain-split`].

Notably, the implementation should exercise additional care if one of the following conditions is met:

* There is a chance that two cluster nodes have conflicting Node metadata.
  For example, two nodes with the same hostname are added,
  or one node is migrated to have the same hostname as another

* The network cannot be trusted.
  For example, a network adversary is present that might reroute Raft messages intended for one node to another.
