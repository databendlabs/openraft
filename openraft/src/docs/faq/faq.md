# FAQ

-   **🤔 Why is log id a tuple of `(term, node_id, log_index)`, while standard Raft uses just
    `(term, log_index)`**?

    💡 The log id `(term, node_id, log_index)` is used to minimize the chance of election conflicts.
    This way in every term there could be more than one leaders elected, and the last one is valid.
    See: [`leader-id`](`crate::docs::data::leader_id`) for details.

-   **🤔 How to remove node-2 safely from a cluster `{1, 2, 3}`**?

    💡 Call `Raft::change_membership(btreeset!{1, 3})` to exclude node-2 from
    the cluster. Then wipe out node-2 data.
    **NEVER** modify/erase the data of any node that is still in a raft cluster, unless you know what you are doing.

-   **🤔 Can I wipe out the data of ONE node and wait for the leader to replicate all data to it again**?

    💡 Avoid doing this. Doing so will panic the leader. But it is permitted
    if [`loosen-follower-log-revert`] feature flag is enabled.

    In a raft cluster, although logs are replicated to multiple nodes,
    wiping out a node and restarting it is still possible to cause data loss.
    Assumes the leader is `N1`, followers are `N2, N3, N4, N5`:
    - A log(`a`) that is replicated by `N1` to `N2, N3` is considered committed.
    - At this point, if `N3` is replaced with an empty node, and at once the leader `N1` is crashed. Then `N5` may elected as a new  leader with granted vote by `N3, N4`;
    - Then the new leader `N5` will not have log `a`.

    ```text
    Ni: Node i
    Lj: Leader   at term j
    Fj: Follower at term j

    N1 | L1  a  crashed
    N2 | F1  a
    N3 | F1  a  erased          F2
    N4 |                        F2
    N5 |                 elect  L2
    ----------------------------+---------------> time
                                Data loss: N5 does not have log `a`
    ```

    But for even number nodes cluster, Erasing **exactly one** node won't cause data loss.
    Thus, in a special scenario like this, or for testing purpose, you can use
    `--feature loosen-follower-log-revert` to permit erasing a node.

-   **🤔 Is Openraft resilient to incorrectly configured clusters?**

    💡 No, Openraft, like standard raft, cannot identify errors in cluster configuration.

    A common error is the assigning a wrong network addresses to a node. In such
    a scenario, if this node becomes the leader, it will attempt to replicate
    logs to itself. This will cause Openraft to panic because replication
    messages can only be received by a follower.

    ```text
    thread 'main' panicked at openraft/src/engine/engine_impl.rs:793:9:
    assertion failed: self.internal_server_state.is_following()
    ```

    ```ignore
    // openraft/src/engine/engine_impl.rs:793
    pub(crate) fn following_handler(&mut self) -> FollowingHandler<C> {
        debug_assert!(self.internal_server_state.is_following());
        // ...
    }
    ```
