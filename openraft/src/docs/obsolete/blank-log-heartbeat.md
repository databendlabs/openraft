# Obsolete: blank log heartbeat

[Issue-698](https://github.com/databendlabs/openraft/issues/698)

The original design of using a blank log as a heartbeat message is described in the following chapter.

# Why it is bad 

This design has two problems:

- The heartbeat that sends a blank log introduces additional I/O, as a follower has to persist every log to maintain correctness.

- Although `(term, log_index)` serves as a pseudo time in Raft, measuring whether a node has caught up with the leader and is capable of becoming a new leader, leadership is not solely determined by this pseudo time.
  Wall clock time is also taken into account.

  There may be a case where the pseudo time is not upto date but the clock time is, and the node should not become the leader.
  For example, in a cluster of three nodes, if the leader (node-1) is busy sending a snapshot to node-2(it has not yet replicated the latest logs to a quorum, but node-2 received message from the leader(node-1), thus it knew there is an active leader), node-3 should not seize leadership from node-1.
  This is why there needs to be two types of time, pseudo time `(term, log_index)` and wall clock time, to protect leadership.

  In the follow graph:
    - node-1 is the leader, has 4 log entries, and is sending a snapshot to
      node-2,
    - node-2 received several chunks of snapshot, and it perceived an active
      leader thus extended leader lease.
    - node-3 tried to send vote request to node-2, although node-2 do not have
      as many logs as node-3, it should still reject node-3's vote request
      because the leader lease has not yet expired.

  In the obsolete design, extending pseudo time `(term, index)` with a
  `tick`, in this case node-3 will seize the leadership from node-2.

  ```text
  Ni: Node i
  Ei: log entry i

  N1 E1 E2 E3 E4
        |
        v
  N2    snapshot
        +-----------------+
                 ^        |
                 |        leader lease
                 |
  N3 E1 E2 E3    | vote-request
  ---------------+----------------------------> clock time
                 now

  ```

# Heartbeat in openraft

## Heartbeat in standard raft

Heartbeat in standard raft is the way for a leader to assert it is still alive:
- A leader send heartbeat at a regular interval.
- A follower that receives a heartbeat believes there is an active leader thus it rejects election request(`send_vote`) from another node unreachable to the leader, for a short period.

## Openraft heartbeat is a blank log

Such a heartbeat mechanism depends on clock time.
But raft as a distributed consensus already has its own **pseudo time** defined very well.
Raft, or other consensus protocol has its own **pseudo time** defined internally:
- In [paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) it is `round_number`(AKA ballot number in some paper).
- In the standard raft it is `(term, voted_for, last_log_index)`(because in standard raft there is only one leader in every term, `voted_for` can be removed: `(term, last_log_index)`).

The **pseudo time** in openraft is a tuple `(vote, last_log_id)`, compared in dictionary order(`vote` is equivalent concept as round number in Paxos).

### Why it works

To refuse the election by a node that does not receive recent messages from the current leader,
just let the active leader send a **blank log** to increase the **pseudo time** on a quorum.

Because the leader must have the greatest **pseudo time**,
thus by comparing the **pseudo time**, a follower automatically refuse election request from a node unreachable to the leader.

And comparing the **pseudo time** is already done by `handle_vote_request()`,
there is no need to add another timer for the active leader.

Thus making heartbeat request a blank log is the simplest way.

## Why blank log heartbeat?

- Simple, get rid of a timer.

  Without heartbeat log(the way standard raft does), when handling a vote
  request, except `vote` itself, it has to examine two values to determine if
  the vote request is valid:
    - Whether the last heartbeat has expired by clock time.
    - Whether the `(last_term, last_log_index)` in the request is greater or equal to the local value. This is the pseudo time Raft defines.

  With heartbeat log(the way openraft does), when handling a vote request, it only needs to examine one value: the raft time: `(last_term, last_log_index)`. This makes the logic simpler and the test easier to write.

- Easy to prove, and reduce code complexity.


## Concerns

- **More raft logs are generated**.
  This requires to *persist* the blank entry in the log (or at least the incremented index).
  E.g., doing that every 50ms for 100 consensus domains on one machine will require 2000 IOPS alone for that.

  **Why it is not a problem**:

    1. Assume that most consensus domains are busy, and as a domain is busy, it is possible to merge multiple `append-entry` calls into one call to the storage layer.
       Thus if a domain swallows `10` business log entries per `50 ms`, it's likely to merge these 10 entries into one or a few IO calls.
       The IO amplification should be smaller as IOPS gets more.

       Merging entries into one IO call is naturally done on followers(because the leader sends entries in a batch).
       On the leader, it's not done yet(2022 Sep 13). It can be done when the Engine oriented refactoring is ready: (.

    2. If a consensus domain swallows `1` business log entry per `50 ms`. It does not need another heartbeat. A normal append-entry can be considered a heartbeat.
