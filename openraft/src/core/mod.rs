//! The `RaftCore` is a `Runtime` supporting the raft algorithm implementation `Engine`.
//!
//! It passes events from an application or timer or network to `Engine` to drive it to run.
//! Also it receives and execute `Command` emitted by `Engine` to apply raft state to underlying storage or forward
//! messages to other raft nodes.
