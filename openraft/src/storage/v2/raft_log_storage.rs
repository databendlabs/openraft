/// `vote` API are also included because in raft, vote is part to the log: `vote` is about **when**,
/// while `log` is about **what**. A distributed consensus is about **at what a time, happened what
/// a event**.
///
/// ### To ensure correctness:
///
/// - Logs must be consecutive, i.e., there must **NOT** leave a **hole** in logs.
/// - All write-IO must be serialized, i.e., the internal implementation must **NOT** apply a latter
///   write request before a former write request is completed. This rule applies to both `vote` and
///   `log` IO. E.g., Saving a vote and appending a log entry must be serialized too.
