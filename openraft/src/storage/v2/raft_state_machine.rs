    /// It is all right to return a membership with greater log id than the
    /// last-applied-log-id.

    /// have been replicated to a quorum of the cluster, will be applied to the state machine.
    ///
    /// This is where the business logic of interacting with your application's state machine
    /// should live. This is 100% application-specific. Perhaps this is where an
    /// application-specific transaction is being started, or perhaps committed. This may be
    /// where a key/value is being stored.

    /// - Store the log id as last-applied log id.
    /// - Deal with the business logic log.

    /// storing it.

    /// An implementation may choose to persist either the state machine or the snapshot:
    ///
    /// - An implementation with a persistent state machine: persists the state on disk before
    ///   returning from `apply()`. So that a snapshot does not need to be persistent.

    /// - An implementation with a persistent snapshot: `apply()` does not have to persist state on
